            <center> Independence Day (Día de la Independencia) is a Mexican holiday to celebrate the “cry of independence” on September 16, 1810, which started a revolt against the Spaniards.
             It follows from the day of the Cry of Dolores (El Grito de Dolores), on September 15.&ensp;

            Mexicans celebrate their country’s Independence Day with fireworks, parties (fiestas), food, dance and music on September 16. Flags, flowers and decorations in the colors of the Mexican flag – red, white and green – are seen in public areas in cities and towns in Mexico. Whistles and horns are blown and confetti is thrown to celebrate this festive occasion.
              <strong>"Viva Mexico" </strong> or <strong>"Viva la independencia” </strong> are shouted amidst the crowds on this day.</center>&ensp;

            <li>Born in 1753, Father Miguel was already in his mid-fifties when he issued his famous Cry of Dolores. 
                He was by then a distinguished priest, well-versed in theology and religion and a pillar of the Dolores community. 
                He certainly didn't fit the modern stereotype of a wild-eyed, young revolutionary angry at the world!</li>&ensp;

            <li>Father Miguel was far better of a revolutionary than a priest. His promising academic career was derailed by his introduction of liberal ideas into his teaching curriculum and for misuse of money entrusted to him while teaching at the seminary. </li>&ensp;
            
            <li>After the Spanish war fleet was mostly sunk at the Battle of Trafalgar in October of 1805, King Carlos found himself in dire need of funds.</li>&ensp;
            
            <li>Every year, Mexicans celebrate September 16 as their Independence Day. That’s not the date Hidalgo had in mind, however. Hidalgo and his fellow conspirators had originally selected December as the best time for their uprising and were planning accordingly</li>
            
            <li>Father Miguel knew where his strengths lay: he was not a soldier, but a thinker.</li>&ensp;

            <li>In November of 1810, Hidalgo was very close to victory. He had marched across Mexico with his army and had defeated a desperate Spanish defense at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces. </li>&ensp;

            <li>After the disastrous Battle of Calderon Bridge, Hidalgo, Allende and other revolutionary leaders made a run for the border with the USA where they could regroup and rearm in safety</li>&ensp;

            <li>Although Father Miguel never renounced the priesthood, the Catholic Church was quick to distance itself from his actions.</li>&ensp;

            <li>Although he did not actually free Mexico from Spanish rule, Father Miguel is considered the founding father of the nation. </li>&ensp;
